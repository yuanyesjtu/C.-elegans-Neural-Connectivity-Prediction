# C.-elegans-Neural-Connectivity-Prediction

## 1. Project File Descriptions

- **`config.py`**  
  Contains configuration settings for model design and training.

- **`graph_feat_prepare.py`**  
  Responsible for constructing the Graph Neural Network (GNN), and for data loading and preprocessing.

- **`modules.py`**  
  Includes the LSTM and GNN modules used in the model.

- **`process_data_of_Figure1_and_Table1.py`**  
  Processes experimental results and generates the plots for Figure 1 and Table 1.

- **`process_data_of_Table2.py`**  
  Processes experimental results and generates the plots for Table 2.

- **`run_gnn.py`**  
  The main program of the project; serves as the entry point for model training and testing.

- **`data/`**  
  Directory that stores neural connectivity files and calcium activity data.
